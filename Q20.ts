// Question no 20: Think of something you could store in a array.
//For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like.
// Write a program that creates a list containing these items.


//Storing List of food items in array:
let myFavoriteDishes: string[] = ["Pizza", "Pasta", "Handi", "Ami ke hath ka pulao", "Fast food"];

//Printing food items:
console.log("myFavoriteDishes:");

//Printing food items in list:
myFavoriteDishes.forEach(myFavoriteDish => console.log(myFavoriteDish));
