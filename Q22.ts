// Question no 22: Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen.
//Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

//Creating an array:
let errorArray: string[] = ["orange", "mango", "pine apple"];

//Producing error ! by accessing invalid value of array:
//console.log(errorArray[6]);
//it is undefined.


//Removing error:
console.log(errorArray[2]);
