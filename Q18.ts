//Question no 18: Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit.

//Step no 1 :• Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in alphabetical order:
let favPlaces: string[] = ["Makkah", "Madina", "Dubai", "Bali", "Japan"];

//• Print your array in its original order:
console.log("Array in its original order:", favPlaces);

//• Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list:
console.log("Array in alphabetical order:", [...favPlaces].sort());

//• Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it.
console.log("Array is still in original order:", favPlaces);

//• Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list
console.log("Array in reverse alphabetical order:", [...favPlaces].reverse());

//• Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it again.
console.log("Array is still in original order:", favPlaces);

//• Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its order has changed
console.log("Reverse order of list:", favPlaces.reverse());

//• Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order
console.log("Back to its original order:", favPlaces.reverse());

//• Sort your array so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.
console.log("Sorting array to store in alphabetical order:", favPlaces.sort());

//• Sort to change your array so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has changed
console.log("Stored in reverse alphabetical order:", favPlaces.reverse());
